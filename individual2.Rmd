```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Prepare the Data and Packages
```{r}
acc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/accident.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

##Part One:
###______Number of Crashes Each Day______
```{r Number of Crashes Each Day}
ggplot(acc,aes(x=factor(DAY_WEEK),fill=factor(DAY_WEEK))) + geom_bar(stat_count='identity') + ylab('Number of Crashes') + xlab("Day of the Week") + scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),labels=c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday")) + ggtitle("Number of Crashes Each Day") + guides(fill=guide_legend("Days of the Week"))
```

###______Number of Crashes Each Hour______
```{r}
ggplot(acc,aes(x=factor(HOUR),fill=factor(HOUR))) + geom_bar(stat_count='identity') + ylab('Number of Crashes Per Hour') + xlab("Hour of Day") + ggtitle("Number of Crashes Each Hour") + guides(fill=guide_legend("Days of the Month"))
```

###______Number of Crashes With Drunk Drivers______
```{r}
ggplot(acc,aes(x=factor(DRUNK_DR),fill=factor(DRUNK_DR))) + geom_bar(stat_count='identity') + ylab('Number of Crashes') + xlab("Number of Drunk Drivers") + ggtitle("Number of Crashes With Drunk Drivers")  + guides(fill=guide_legend("Number of Drunks"))
```

##Part Two:
#####Person Type 1 is the Driver of the vehicle
```{r}
person <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/person.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
filperson = filter(person, PER_TYP==1)
joined = inner_join(filperson, acc, by = "ST_CASE", type = "inner", match = "all")
```
###______Number of Crashes Each Day of the Week By Hour and Sex______
```{r}
joined = filter(joined, joined$HOUR.x < 25)
joined = filter(joined, joined$SEX < 3)
joined$DAY_WEEK = factor(joined$DAY_WEEK,labels=c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"))
ggplot(joined,aes(x=HOUR.x,fill=factor(SEX))) + geom_bar(position="dodge") + facet_wrap(joined$DAY_WEEK) + xlab("Hour of the Day") + ylab("Number of Crashes") + ggtitle("Number of Crashes Each Day of the Week by Hour and Sex") + guides(fill=guide_legend("SEX")) + scale_fill_discrete(name = "SEX", labels = c("Male","Female"))
```

##Part Three:
###______Number of Crashes Per County______
```{r}
GLC = readxl::read_xlsx("GLC.xlsx")
colnames(GLC) = GLC[1, ] 
GLC = GLC[-1, ]
counties = map_data("county")
names(GLC)[6] = "COUNTY"
names(GLC)[7] = "County_Name"
GLC$COUNTY = factor(GLC$COUNTY)
acc$COUNTY = factor(acc$COUNTY)
names(counties)[6] = "County_Name"
countacc = inner_join(acc,GLC, by="COUNTY") %>% select(LATITUDE,LONGITUD,COUNTY,"County_Name",DAY,MONTH,YEAR,HOUR,"State Name")
countacc = countacc %>% mutate(County_Name = tolower(County_Name))
countaccgroup = countacc %>% group_by(County_Name) %>% summarise(total_crashes = n())
countaccgroup = left_join(countaccgroup,counties, by="County_Name")
head(countaccgroup)
countaccgroup %>% group_by("COUNTY") %>% ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat,fill=log(total_crashes))) + geom_polygon(aes(group=group)) + ggtitle("Crashes Per County")  + guides(fill=guide_legend("Total Crashes")) + scale_fill_continuous(low="white",high = ("red"))
```

###______Ratio of Crashes Per State by Season______
```{r}
states = map_data("state")
countaccseason = countacc %>% group_by(County_Name,MONTH) %>% summarise(total_crashes=n())
countaccseason = transform(countaccseason, SEASON = case_when((countaccseason$MONTH >= 11 | countaccseason$MONTH <= 3) ~ "WINTER", (countaccseason$MONTH >= 5 & countaccseason$MONTH <= 8) ~ "SUMMER"))
countaccseason = countaccseason[complete.cases(countaccseason[,4]),]
countaccseason = countaccseason %>% group_by(County_Name,SEASON) %>% summarise(total_crash = sum(total_crashes))  
countaccseason = countaccseason %>% left_join(counties,by="County_Name")
countaccseason = countaccseason %>% group_by(region,SEASON) %>% summarise(total_crashes=sum(total_crash))
countaccseason = countaccseason %>% spread(SEASON,total_crashes)
countaccseason = countaccseason %>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(ratioSUMbyWINT = SUMMER/WINTER)
countaccseason = countaccseason %>% left_join(states,by="region")
countaccseason %>% group_by("region") %>% ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat,fill=ratioSUMbyWINT)) + geom_polygon(aes(group=group)) + ggtitle("Ratio of Total Crashes Per State (Summer/Winter)")  + guides(fill=guide_legend("Crash Percentage")) + scale_fill_continuous(low="red",high = ("white"))
```

As you can see the map is most red in Delaware meaning that the difference in crashes is the largest. Therefore Delaware has the worst time driving in the winter months.
