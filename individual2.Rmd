## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
acc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/accident.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(acc)
```

Part One:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(acc,aes(x=factor(DAY_WEEK),fill=factor(DAY_WEEK))) + geom_bar(stat_count='identity') + ylab('Number of Crashes') + xlab("Day of the Week") + scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7),labels=c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday")) + ggtitle("Number of Crashes Each Day")
```

```{r}
ggplot(acc,aes(x=factor(HOUR),fill=factor(HOUR))) + geom_bar(stat_count='identity') + ylab('Number of Crashes Per Hour') + xlab("Hour of Day") + ggtitle("Number of Crashes Each Hour")
```


```{r}
ggplot(acc,aes(x=factor(DRUNK_DR),fill=factor(DRUNK_DR))) + geom_bar(stat_count='identity') + ylab('Number of Crashes') + xlab("Number of Drunk Drivers") + ggtitle("Number of Crashes With Drunk Drivers")
```

Person Type 1 is the Driver of the vehicle
County appears in the PERSON and ACCIDENT will innerjoin with this
```{r}
person <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/fars2017/person.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(person)
head(person)
head(acc)
filperson = filter(person, PER_TYP==1)
joined = inner_join(filperson, acc, by = "ST_CASE", type = "inner", match = "all")
joined
```
